**Portfolio Website (macOS-Portfolio) Overview:**
- This is a macOS-inspired portfolio web app, built with React, TypeScript, and CSS, designed to mimic the look and feel of a real Mac desktop.
- The UI features a desktop background, draggable app windows, a dock, a menu bar, and interactive desktop icons.
- The site is fully responsive and works on both desktop and mobile browsers.
- The codebase is organized with a clear separation of components (AppWindow, DesktopIcon, DesktopIcons, Dock, MenuBar, WeatherWidget, SiriChatbot, etc.).
- The project uses modern React best practices, including functional components, hooks, and TypeScript for type safety.
- The design is modular, with reusable UI elements and a focus on maintainability and cross-browser compatibility.

**Key Features:**
- **App Windows:** Each section (About Me, Projects, Experience, Resume, Skills, Contact, Terminal) opens in a draggable, resizable window, just like macOS.
- **Dock:** The bottom dock allows quick access to key apps/sections.
- **Menu Bar:** The top menu bar displays the active app, time, and system-like controls.
- **Desktop Icons:** Clickable icons on the desktop open corresponding app windows.
- **Weather Widget:** Shows real-time weather for the user's location.
- **Siri Chatbot:** A floating, draggable Siri-style chatbot that can answer questions about Prajwal, his work, and the portfolio itself. It uses Gemini for conversational AI.
- **Voice Input:** The chatbot supports voice-to-text using the browser's speech recognition (where available).
- **Resume Viewer:** The resume is viewable in a PDF window, styled like a Mac app.
- **Terminal:** A simulated terminal window supports commands like 'help', 'whoami', 'ls', 'cd', 'pwd', 'echo', and more, for a playful developer experience.
- **Mobile Responsive:** The layout adapts for mobile devices, with touch-friendly controls.
